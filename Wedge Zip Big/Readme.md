### THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT JOHN!! YOU SHOULD READ IT!!

Wedge Part 1 is broken up between Gilbert_Big_Clean, which cleans the zip files, and Gilbert_Wedge_GBQ, which pushes the data into GBQ.
Wedge Part 2 utilizes the Gilbert_Wedge_Part2 notebook.
Wedge Part 3 utilizes the Gilbert_Wedge_Part3 notebook.

The csv, txt, and db files associated with this project are available upon request for a small fee that might exactly match this semester's tuition. COVID is temporary, Wu-Tang is forever.

# I TOTALLY DID READ IT. I <3 READING. WU-TANG CLAN AIN'T NOTHING TO F*CK WITH

More feedback:

* Part 1 looks good. Theoretically it'd be nice to delete those commented out lines, but no biggie.
Query results look super close, it's interesting to see such small differences. Not profitable to track
them down though, obviously. 
* Part 2: This is smooth as silk
* Part 3: You really should have descriptive names for your tables ("sales_owner_date" vs "Table2"), but 
let's just look the other way on that, mmkay. 

Nice work, you're done!
